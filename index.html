				<h1>So, what's considered defamation?</h1>	
				
				<p>
					<b>A Brief History of Defamation</b><br>
Early Internet policies were pretty loose and depended on people being good people to begin with. However, people discovered fast that people can be f***wads on the Internet.<br>


<b>How do we decide if something is defamation?</b>
<br>
First, let’s define a few terms.</p>
<ol>
<li class="bottom">Defamation - when you publish something that is false and harmful to someone’s reputation, and published with fault (as a result of negligence or malice)</li>
<li class="bottom">Negligence - when you don’t behave with the level of care that an ordinary person would have acted with</li>
<li class="bottom">Malice - when you purposely want to hurt someone else</li>
</ol><p>
Of course, defamation possibly occurs all the time. After all, it’s hard to prove malice--that you intentionally wanted to hurt someone else with a certain false statement. However, it is possible to be held liable for defamation.<br>

<b>To create liability for defamation there must be:</b></p>
<ol>
<li class="bottom">a false and defamatory statement concerning another</li>
<li class="bottom">an unprivileged publication to a third party--the word publication is important!</li>
<li class="bottom">fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher [with respect to the act of publication</li>
<li class="bottom">either actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm or the existence of special harm caused by the publication</li>
</ol>
<p><b>There are three types of people under defamation law:</b><br>
<ol>
<li class="bottom">Public Official<br>
When a government official is criticized in a false way for something that relates to their behavior in office, the official needs to prove actual malice on top of all the other defamation criteria.
Actual malice is whether or not the person making the statement knew that the statement was false at the time, or showed reckless disregard for verifying whether it was true or not.</li>

<li class="bottom">Public Figure<br>
People who are public figures get much less protection from defamatory statements. <br>
An <b>all-purpose public figure</b> is so powerful and influential that ALL aspects of their lives are of public interest. This means that the actual malice standard applies to all aspects of their lives. An example of an all-purpose public figure would be the President. Her/his position is so powerful that any aspect of her/his life can be subject to public scrutiny.<br>
A <b>limited public figure</b> is only influential or powerful on certain issues, so they receive more protection. The actual malice standard only applies to the aspects of their lives that relate to the public. For instance, Kobe Bryant is a limited public figure because he has specifically distinguished himself through basketball. Thus, he is only subject to the actual malice standard in defamatory statements concerning his basketball playing.</li>
<li class="bottom">
Private Figure<br>
The final category would be a private figure. This is someone who you have no business writing mean tweets about. End of story. 
 <br>A private figure need only prove that there was negligence and fault on the part of the defamer. Negligence is conduct that creates an unreasonable risk of harm based on the behavior of a reasonable person in similar circumstances.</li></ol>
<p><b>Fault can be proved if it meets the following requirements:</p><b>
<ol>
<li class="bottom">The statement is published or conveyed in some way to a third party.</li>
<li class="bottom">The material is false.</li>
<li class="bottom">The material can be interpreted as defamatory based on other facts.</li>
<li class="bottom">The statement might have been an error or had words with double meanings.</li>
<li class="bottom">The defamed person is named or specifically described.</li>
</ol>
<p>
NOTE: The requirements for proving fault can vary from state to state.
